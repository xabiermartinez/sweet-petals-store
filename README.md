## Information

- Styles are very basic, just to fill the structure, with more time I would do with SASS and any design guide. Also, RWD also is reduced to minimum so I could focus in logic.
- Finally decided to set aside tests for now, as I have lack of front tests and I'll last a lot more than 5 hours just on that.
